Postman API Testing
The Postman API Testing project is focused on automating and validating RESTful API endpoints using Postman. 
It involves creating test collections for different HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to ensure the functionality, performance, and reliability of APIs.
The project demonstrates how to perform essential tests such as checking status codes, validating content types, asserting response bodies, and measuring response times.

It provides a structured approach to test APIs in both manual and automated ways.
Users can run tests directly in the Postman interface or automate them using Newman, the Postman CLI tool, for integration with continuous integration (CI) pipelines.

With reusable collections and environments, this project simplifies the process of API testing, making it easy for developers and QA engineers to validate APIs efficiently.
The goal is to ensure that APIs are reliable and meet expected behavior across different use cases.
